You're describing a spatial sampling problem where **K seed points** must be selected in a 2D grid of size \( $M \times N$ \), such that:

- Points are **evenly distributed** (uniform spatial coverage).
- **Minimum distance** between any pair of points is \( $d > \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot N}{K}}$ \), ensuring no clustering.

To achieve this with **simple yet effective** algorithms (avoiding complex greedy Poisson-disk sampling), here are **three strong and straightforward strategies**:

---

# deterministic

### ✅ 1. **Hexagonal Grid Sampling (Best uniformity & simplicity)**

**Idea:** Place seed points on a **hexagonal lattice**, which is the most efficient packing in 2D (maximizes minimum distance and uniform coverage).

**Steps:**

- Compute the number of rows and columns based on spacing \( d \).
- Offset every other row to form a hexagonal pattern.
- Choose the first **K points** from the grid that fit within the image bounds.

**Advantages:**

- Very **uniform** spatial distribution.
- **Guaranteed minimum distance** \( d \), provided by spacing.
- **Fast** and easy to implement.

---

### ✅ 2. **Grid Subsampling (Simple and deterministic)**

**Idea:** Divide the image into a **uniform grid** of size \( $\sqrt{K} \times \sqrt{K}$ \), and place one point in each cell center.

**Steps:**

- Compute the grid cell size: \( $\text{cell size} = \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot N}{K}}$ \).
- Place a seed point at the center of each grid cell.

**Advantages:**

- Ensures even distribution and sufficient spacing.
- Deterministic and **very efficient**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Jittered Grid Sampling (Adds randomness while keeping spacing)**

**Idea:** Similar to grid subsampling, but instead of placing points in the center of each cell, randomly jitter the point within a margin around the center.

**Steps:**

- Divide image into \( $\sqrt{K} \times \sqrt{K}$ ) cells.
- In each cell, choose a point randomly within a small neighborhood of the center, ensuring it doesn’t violate the distance threshold.

**Advantages:**

- Maintains good spacing with a more natural (non-grid-like) distribution.
- Still very fast, and avoids clustering.

---

### ⚠️ Avoid:

- **Poisson Disk Sampling (Greedy or Bridson):** While it guarantees minimum distance, it’s overkill for fixed K and slower than the above.
- **Random Sampling with Rejection:** Inefficient when K is large or spacing is tight.

---

### Summary

| Method           | Uniformity | Min Distance | Speed    | Notes                |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| Hexagonal Grid   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Best overall         |
| Grid Subsampling | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easiest to implement |
| Jittered Grid    | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐   | Adds randomness      |

# random

the three methods I mentioned earlier are either **deterministic** (grid-based, hexagonal) or **only slightly random** (jittered grid), which means that **each run will produce very similar or identical results** unless jitter is added.

If your requirement is that  **each of the K seed sets should be randomly distributed** , while still:

* Enforcing **minimum distance $d>M⋅NKd > \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot N}{K}}$** between any two points
* Maintaining **spatial uniformity** (avoid clustering or uneven spread)

Then you need **controlled randomness** with spacing enforcement.

---

Here are **simple, effective, and random** methods you can use:

---

### ✅ 1. **Random Sampling with Distance Rejection**

**Idea:** Randomly place points, but **reject** any point that violates the minimum distance constraint.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize an empty list of accepted points.
2. Repeat until you have $K$ points:
   * Randomly sample a point in the image.
   * Check if it's at least distance $d$ away from all accepted points.
   * If yes, accept it; if not, reject and try again.

**Pros:**

* Fully random and satisfies the distance constraint.
* Easy to implement.

**Cons:**

* Becomes **slow** if $K $is too large or $d$ is too big.
* Still good for moderate values of K (e.g., K < 1000).

---

### ✅ 2. **Jittered Grid Sampling (Randomized version)**

This is a **hybrid** method — it divides the image into a grid (to ensure spacing), but **adds randomness** in each cell.

**Algorithm:**

1. Divide the image into $K×K\sqrt{K} \times \sqrt{K}$ cells.
2. In each cell, sample one point randomly within the cell.
3. Shuffle all sampled points and pick the first K.

**Pros:**

* Enforces spacing via the grid.
* Each run produces **different** random seed points.
* More efficient than pure rejection.

**Cons:**

* Slightly less random than full rejection, but much faster.

---

### ✅ 3. **Blue Noise Sampling via Bridson’s Algorithm (Optional)**

This is a more advanced form of **Poisson-disk sampling** that produces evenly spaced, but  **random-looking distributions** .

* Enforces **minimum distance**
* Produces **random results**
* Computationally heavier, but not as bad as greedy variants

You said to avoid greedy Poisson methods, so only consider this if you’re okay with a slightly more complex algorithm for better quality.

### Summary Table (Randomness + Simplicity)

| Method                          | Randomness | Uniformity | Min Distance | Speed    | Best Use Case                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Random Sampling + Rejection     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐     | K is small or moderate          |
| Jittered Grid Sampling (random) | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Balance of speed and randomness |
| Blue Noise (Bridson)            | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐     | Best quality but more complex   |

---

### Recommendation

For your case, where you want  **random seed sets that differ per generation** , go with:

* **Jittered Grid Sampling** for simplicity and randomness.
* Or **Random Sampling with Distance Rejection** if full randomness is more important than speed.

# Jittered Grid Sampling (random)

Sure! Here's a clear and simple introduction to **Jittered Grid Sampling (Random)**, tailored to your spatial sampling problem.

---

## 🎯 **Jittered Grid Sampling (Randomized)**

### 📌 **Purpose**

Select **K seed points** randomly in a 2D image of size \( M \times N \), ensuring:

- Each run generates a **different distribution**
- **Uniform spatial coverage** (no clustering)
- **Minimum distance \( $d > \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot N}{K}}$ \)** between any two points (approximately guaranteed)

---

### 🧠 **Core Idea**

We divide the image into a **regular grid** of cells — one for each seed — and **sample one point randomly inside each cell**.

This gives you **well-distributed random points** with a **controlled minimum spacing**, but without fixed or repeated positions across runs.

---

### 🧮 **Step-by-Step Algorithm**

Let:

- \( $K$ \) = number of seed points
- \( $M \times N$ \) = image size (height × width)
- \( $\text{cell width} = \sqrt{\frac{N \cdot M}{K}}$ \)

1. **Compute Grid Size**

   - Choose number of rows \( $r \approx \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot K}{N}}$ \)
   - Choose number of cols \( $c = \frac{K}{r}$ \)
2. **Tile the Image into Grid Cells**

   - Divide the image into \( $r \times c$ \) cells of size \( $\frac{M}{r} \times \frac{N}{c}$ \)
3. **Sample One Point per Cell**
   For each cell:

   - Randomly choose a point inside the cell (add "jitter")
4. **Return All Sampled Points**
   Shuffle if needed, and pick only K if extra.

    grid_size = int(np.sqrt(K))
    rows, cols = grid_size, grid_size
    while rows * cols < K:
        cols += 1

        for j in range(cols):
            if len(points) >= K:
                break
            # Random jitter inside each cell
            y = np.random.uniform(i * cell_height, (i + 1) * cell_height)
            x = np.random.uniform(j * cell_width, (j + 1) * cell_width)
            points.append((x, y))

    return np.array(points)
```

### 🎯 When to Use It

Use **Jittered Grid Sampling (Random)** when you want:

- A **new, random seed distribution** every time
- **Good spacing**, but without the slowness of rejection sampling
- A **simple and effective** implementation

---

# Voronoi relaxation method

**Voronoi relaxation**, also known as **Lloyd’s Algorithm**, is **a very good solution** for your problem if you're looking for:

- **Uniform spatial distribution**
- **Randomized initial positions** (each generation is different)
- **Approximate enforcement of minimum distance**
- A **smoother, more regular point layout** than raw random sampling

Let me walk you through it.

---

## 🎯 **What is Voronoi Relaxation (Lloyd’s Algorithm)?**

**Voronoi relaxation** is an iterative method that improves the **uniformity** of randomly placed points. It works by:

1. **Starting with random points**
2. Building a **Voronoi diagram**
3. Moving each point to the **centroid** of its Voronoi cell
4. Repeating steps 2–3 several times

The result is a **blue-noise-like**, even distribution of points, without being fully deterministic like a grid.

---

## 🧩 **How it fits your requirements**

| Requirement                          | Voronoi Relaxation ✅   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Random seed positions per generation | ✅ Yes (random start)   |
| Even spatial coverage                | ✅ Improves iteratively |
| Minimum spacing between points       | ✅ Approximate          |
| Simple and strong                    | ✅ Conceptually simple  |

Note: The **minimum distance** isn't strictly guaranteed, but spacing improves naturally with each iteration, and usually exceeds your \( d = \sqrt{\frac{M \cdot N}{K}} \) threshold after a few iterations.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works (Summary)**

1. **Initialize**: Randomly sample K seed points in the image.
2. **Repeat** for 5–10 iterations:
   - Compute Voronoi diagram of the points.
   - For each cell, compute its centroid.
   - Move the point to the centroid.
3. **Output**: A refined, uniform distribution of points.

Each run starts from scratch, so **you get a different result every time**, but with very good evenness.

---

## 🔧 Python Pseudocode Outline

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial import Voronoi, voronoi_plot_2d

def lloyd_relaxation(points, bounds, iterations=10):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        vor = Voronoi(points)
        new_points = []
        for region_index in vor.point_region:
            region = vor.regions[region_index]
            if not -1 in region and len(region) > 0:
                polygon = np.array([vor.vertices[i] for i in region])
                centroid = np.mean(polygon, axis=0)
                if np.all(centroid >= [0, 0]) and np.all(centroid <= bounds):
                    new_points.append(centroid)
        points = np.array(new_points)
        if len(points) < K:
            # Refill to keep number constant
            extra = np.random.rand(K - len(points), 2) * bounds
            points = np.vstack([points, extra])
    return points
```

## 🧠 When to Use It

Use **Voronoi relaxation** when:

- You want **visually pleasing, regular spacing**
- You want **random input**, but **smoothed** output
- You’re okay with a bit of computation for higher quality

---

### 🚀 Summary: Should You Use It?

| Method                       | Random | Uniform | Enforces Min Distance | Quality | Speed  |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Jittered Grid                | ✅     | ✅      | ~Yes                  | Medium  | ✅✅✅ |
