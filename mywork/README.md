data structure and algorithm course opencv lab project

developed on linux

## lab requirement


### Input

- Any M * N color image

### Tools

- VSCode or a compiler on Mac/Linux platform
- OpenCV library
- Pure C language or C/C++ language

### Requirements

- Learn to use the STL Standard Template Library and basic OpenCV data formats
- Minimize the use of static arrays, use pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation
- Reasonably divide the source code into files and functions to ensure module independence
- Follow naming conventions for functions, variables, constants, etc. (avoid using Chinese pinyin)
- Provide macro comments for files and functions, and micro comments for core variables and code segments
- Validate input legality and provide functionality and fault tolerance prompts
- Optimize algorithms as much as possible to ensure stability and low time-space complexity
- Design and optimize the interaction logic and visual UI of the demo
